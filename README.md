had fun with some of the numbers... 
tried a little css on the side cause i didnt want to keep writing <style> in my code

Version 2 update:
added Branch: Version 1
added news site code to main
I personally like the headers ive made
I might have also been a little goofy and first added the newsite code to version1 and then merged it with main... version1 is now pre newsite code... as it's supposed to be.
